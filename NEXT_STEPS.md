# Next Steps After TSE-0001.4 Completion

## Overview

With TSE-0001.4 (Data Adapters & Orchestrator Integration) complete for the custodian domain, we now have:
- ✅ custodian-data-adapter-go repository with 5 repository interfaces
- ✅ custodian-simulator-go integrated with DataAdapter
- ✅ orchestrator-docker PostgreSQL schema and Redis ACL configured
- ✅ Docker deployment running and healthy

## Current Status: TSE-0001.4.1 - Custodian Testing Suite

**Priority**: HIGH (Before TSE-0001.6 implementation)

### What's Being Built
Following the audit-data-adapter-go testing pattern to create comprehensive BDD behavior tests:

1. **Test Infrastructure** (tests/init_test.go, behavior_test_suite.go)
   - BDD framework with Given/When/Then pattern
   - Automatic resource cleanup
   - Performance assertions
   - Environment configuration

2. **Repository Tests** (7 test files)
   - Position behavior tests (CRUD, queries, quantity management)
   - Settlement behavior tests (lifecycle, status transitions)
   - Balance behavior tests (atomic updates, reconciliation)
   - Service discovery tests (registration, heartbeat, cleanup)
   - Cache behavior tests (TTL, pattern operations)
   - Integration tests (cross-repository workflows)
   - Comprehensive tests (full system validation)

3. **Tooling**
   - ✅ Makefile with testing targets (test-position, test-settlement, test-balance, etc.)
   - ✅ tests/README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - Docker setup for test databases
   - CI/CD integration

### Success Criteria
- All test suites passing with >90% success rate
- Test coverage >80% for all repository implementations
- Performance tests validating latency < 100ms
- Integration tests validating full custodian workflows
- CI/CD ready with automatic environment detection

## Replication Pattern for Other Domains

Once TSE-0001.4.1 is complete, the same pattern will be replicated for:

### 1. Exchange-Simulator-Go (TSE-0001.4.2)

**New Components**:
- exchange-data-adapter-go repository
  - Repositories: Order, Trade, OrderBook, Position, ServiceDiscovery, Cache
  - PostgreSQL schema: exchange.orders, exchange.trades, exchange.order_books, exchange.positions
  - Redis ACL: exchange-adapter user with exchange:* namespace

**Integration Points**:
- exchange-simulator-go integration via go.mod dependency
- Docker deployment to trading-ecosystem network
- Service discovery registration

**Testing**:
- TSE-0001.4.2.1: Exchange Testing Suite (following custodian pattern)

### 2. Market-Data-Simulator-Go (TSE-0001.4.3)

**New Components**:
- market-data-adapter-go repository
  - Repositories: MarketData, Ticker, OHLCV, OrderBook, ServiceDiscovery, Cache
  - PostgreSQL schema: market_data.tickers, market_data.ohlcv, market_data.order_books
  - Redis ACL: market-data-adapter user with market_data:* namespace

**Integration Points**:
- market-data-simulator-go integration via go.mod dependency
- Docker deployment to trading-ecosystem network
- Service discovery registration

**Testing**:
- TSE-0001.4.3.1: Market Data Testing Suite (following custodian pattern)

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Complete Custodian Testing (Current)
- TSE-0001.4.1: Custodian Testing Suite
- Estimated: 2-3 days
- Deliverable: Fully tested custodian-data-adapter-go

### Phase 2: Exchange Data Adapter
- TSE-0001.4.2: Exchange Data Adapter & Orchestrator Integration
- TSE-0001.4.2.1: Exchange Testing Suite
- Estimated: 3-4 days (faster with established pattern)
- Deliverable: Fully tested exchange-data-adapter-go

### Phase 3: Market Data Adapter
- TSE-0001.4.3: Market Data Adapter & Orchestrator Integration
- TSE-0001.4.3.1: Market Data Testing Suite
- Estimated: 3-4 days (similar to exchange)
- Deliverable: Fully tested market-data-adapter-go

### Phase 4: Service Implementation
With all data adapters and testing complete:
- TSE-0001.6: Custodian Foundation (primary custodian functionality)
- TSE-0001.5b: Exchange Order Processing
- TSE-0001.5a: Market Data Generation

## Pattern Validation Benefits

By completing TSE-0001.4.1 first, we:
1. **Validate the testing pattern** from audit-data-adapter-go works for custodian domain
2. **Identify improvements** before replicating to exchange and market-data
3. **Build confidence** in the approach with real test results
4. **Document best practices** for the next two data adapters
5. **Ensure quality** before implementing service layer functionality

## Orchestrator-Docker Status

### Completed Infrastructure
- ✅ PostgreSQL: custodian schema with 3 tables
- ✅ Redis: custodian-adapter ACL user
- ✅ Docker Compose: custodian-simulator service deployed
- ✅ Service Registry: custodian-simulator registered

### Pending Infrastructure (for TSE-0001.4.2 and TSE-0001.4.3)
- ⏳ PostgreSQL: exchange schema with 4 tables
- ⏳ Redis: exchange-adapter ACL user
- ⏳ Docker Compose: exchange-simulator service
- ⏳ Service Registry: exchange-simulator registration

- ⏳ PostgreSQL: market_data schema with 3 tables
- ⏳ Redis: market-data-adapter ACL user
- ⏳ Docker Compose: market-data-simulator service
- ⏳ Service Registry: market-data-simulator registration

## Key Learnings from TSE-0001.4

### What Worked Well
1. **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between interfaces and implementations
2. **DataAdapter Factory**: Centralized lifecycle management
3. **Environment Configuration**: godotenv with .env.example template
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Service operates in stub mode without infrastructure
5. **Multi-Context Docker Build**: Building from parent directory for sibling dependencies
6. **Orchestrator Integration**: Centralized database and Redis management

### Improvements for Next Iterations
1. **Test-First Approach**: Create testing infrastructure simultaneously with data adapter
2. **Documentation as Code**: Update README.md as we build, not after
3. **Schema Validation**: Add database migration scripts early
4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish benchmarks during testing phase
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing from the start

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### Testing Strategy
- Q: Should we implement all test files before running any tests?
- A: Incremental approach - implement and validate one test suite at a time

### Performance Thresholds
- Q: What are acceptable latency targets for database operations?
- A: Following audit pattern - <100ms for individual operations, configurable via env

### Test Data Management
- Q: How do we handle test data cleanup between test runs?
- A: Automatic cleanup with resource tracking (BehaviorTestSuite pattern)

## Success Metrics

### TSE-0001.4 (Completed)
- ✅ 23 files created
- ✅ 5 repository interfaces
- ✅ 3 database tables
- ✅ Docker deployment healthy
- ✅ 100% acceptance criteria met

### TSE-0001.4.1 (In Progress)
- ⏳ 20+ test scenarios
- ⏳ >90% test pass rate
- ⏳ >80% code coverage
- ⏳ Performance benchmarks established
- ⏳ CI/CD integration complete

### Future Epics (TSE-0001.4.2, TSE-0001.4.3)
- Each following same pattern and metrics
- Estimated 6-8 days total for both domains
- Ready for TSE-0001.5 and TSE-0001.6 implementation

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01
**Current Phase**: TSE-0001.4.1 (Custodian Testing Suite)
**Next Phase**: TSE-0001.4.2 (Exchange Data Adapter) or TSE-0001.6 (Custodian Foundation)
**Decision Point**: Complete testing first vs. proceed with service implementation
